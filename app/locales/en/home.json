    "testimonial1": "Saw Jonathan live at an event and the atmosphere was boiling. The tracks played were just right and invited dancing. Would definitely recommend the two 🥳",
    "testimonial2": "Great DJ duo! I was at a party where the two of them played and it was super! The atmosphere was great, the song selection was just right for us and all music requests were immediately implemented 😍",
    "testimonial3": "I saw Jonathan play among other DJ's at a company event and his set was definitely my favourite one! He knows how to fit the mood: sometimes he plays the crowd-pleasers, but also more of niche-tracks which makes you want to think \"ooooh what is this song, I must save it!\". And you just want to DANCE DANCE DANCE!\n\nI believe he is very versatile in his music, and will be able to adapt to whatever taste you have, if you book him."
