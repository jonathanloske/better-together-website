    "greeting": "Hi!",
    "paragraph1": "We are Jonathan & Vera and together we are Better Together 💜 We live in Berlin and are active for you in the Berlin-Brandenburg region.",
    "paragraph2": "Maybe this sounds familiar: At parties, we've repeatedly noticed that the DJ creates strange transitions, that good songs are played too short even though they're celebrated by the crowd, that the music selection has no common thread, that the DJ doesn't know current music... When searching for a DJ for our own wedding, we noticed how few providers fit us. And then we also heard frustration stories from friends where the wedding DJ only played songs that nobody knew or liked.",

  "mission": {
    "paragraph1": "So we thought: Hey, there must be a better way - and best together! #bettertogether Unlike most wedding DJs, we work as a duo. Jonathan is the DJ, Vera takes care of everything else.",
    "paragraph2": "We are both easy-going, empathetic, ambitious - and our fuel is a good connection with the people we work with. Appreciative, open communication is a given for us.",
    "paragraph3": "That means we take care of you. We notice what you're excited about and respond to your wishes. A successful moment for us is when your guests excitedly grab their friends by the shoulder and shout: \"Oooooh, that song!!\" and euphorically storm the dance floor. In short: We take joy in enabling you the best evening ever-ever ✨"

That's why we always have the latest music for you. He also takes care of various tasks, such as communication with you. By profession, Jonathan is an IT consultant. Technical tasks, like keeping the website running, are therefore a home game for him.",
